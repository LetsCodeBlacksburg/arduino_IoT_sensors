This is the letscodeblacksburg.org "arduino_IoT_sensors" project for intermediate level arduino hackers.  It leverages the ESP8266 (ESP01) WiFi module to get your IoT (Internet of Things) sensors onto your local WiFi network and serve a very simple web-server (using WiFi ESP by bportaluri https://github.com/bportaluri/WiFiEsp), allowing you monitor things in your home (or datacenter) such as humidity, temperature, water on the floor, motion, etc.Using the WiFiESP plus SMTP support, you can set thresholds and send email/SMS alerts, etc.. or build in automation for things like shutting off water mains, etc.
